;; Facilities to display current time/date and a new-mail indicator

Non-nil and not a string means don't check for mail.  nil means use
default, which is system-dependent, and is the same as used by Rmail.")

*Non-nil means \\[display-time] should display day and date as well as time.")

(defvar display-time-24hr-format nil
  "*Non-nil indicates time should be displayed as hh:mm, 0 <= hh <= 23.
Nil means 1 <= hh <= 12, and an AM/PM suffix is used.")

(defvar display-time-string nil)

  "* List of functions to be called when the time is updated on the mode line.")

(defvar display-time-server-down-time nil

and `time-zone' all alphabetic strings, and `mail' a true/nil value.
